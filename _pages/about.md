<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am a researcher interested in Machine Learning, specifically Graph Representation Learning. I am also exploring the privacy in GRL models.

Currently, I am a Ph.D. candidate at [School of Computer Sciences](https://www.niser.ac.in/scps/) at [National Institute of Science Education and Research](https://www.niser.ac.in/), Bhubaneswar, India,  advised by [Subhankar Mishra](http://www.niser.ac.in/~smishra/).


Prior to this, I graduated from [Goa College of Engineering](http://www.gec.ac.in/) with a B.E. in Computer Engineering and [Goa University](https://www.unigoa.ac.in/) with a M.Tech in Computer Science.



<!-- After college I worked at a start-up and then began teaching undergraduate students. -->
